Spotitar
=======

Spotitar is a proof-of-concept Spotify app which shows tabs or chords for the currently playing song. It fetches the tabs and chords from Ultimate-Guitar.com.

## Important
I am not affiliated with Ultimate-Guitar.com and the app has not been approved by anyone. It's a simple proof-of-concept and not intended to be used. If this app violates any rules or guidelines, please contact me and I will remove the repo ASAP!

## How to test the app
1. Clone the repo from Github or [download](https://github.com/Linuus/spotitar/archive/master.zip) it as a zip-file.

2. Extract and put the content in:
  OSX: ~/Spotify/spotitar
  Windows: User/Documents/Spotify/spotitar

3. Apply as a [developer at Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/).

4. Open Spotify and type 'spotify:app:spotitar' in the search field.

5. Press the "Add" button to add the app to your sidebar.

**NOTE:** You have to perform step 4-5 each time you restart your Spotify application.
